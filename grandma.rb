# Write a speak_to_grandma method.

dog = "hungry"

if dog == "hungry"
  puts "DOG Hungry"
else
  puts "Dog not Hungry"
end

# Whatever you say to grandma, she should respond with
# HUH?! SPEAK UP, SONNY!
# unless you shout it (type in all capitals).



# If you shout, she can hear you (or at least she thinks so) 
# and yells back
# NO, NOT SINCE 1938!



# However if you say 'I LOVE YOU GRANDMA!', she should respond with
# 'I LOVE YOU TOO PUMPKIN!'
